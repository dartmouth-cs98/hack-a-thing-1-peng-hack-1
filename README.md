# Dartmouth Pong in Unity
## Marshall Peng COSC 98 Hack-A-Thing-1

### About

This was my attempt at implementing a quick version of the game commonly known at Dartmouth as Dartmouth Pong. I took inspiration and guidance from a youtube Unity tennis tutorial, linked down below, but decided to apply some of the things shown in the first few episodes to Dartmouth pong rather than tennis. Originally, I had intended this to be a VR game. Unfortunately, I don't have a personal VR headset, so I only implemented it in Unity3D. However, when implementing it, I kept the possibility of extending this into Virtual reality, so I focused more on building a framework for the game rather than just implementing it for Unity specifically. 

### I Learned

Also, although this wasn't my first time using Unity, it's been quite a while, and I really needed the refresher. This was my first time creating my own custom model (the cups). I also learned a lot about unity development fundamentals such as project structure conventions, creating prefabs, as well as C# conventions that I had previously skipped out on.

Additionally, I initially experimented quite a bit with Unity's ML-agents in the hopes that I could train a cpu to play using reinforcement learning. Due to time constraints I decided that it would be better to have a functional opponent. However, I did become fairly familiar with the ML-agents library and would likely be able to implement something with it in the future. 


### Shortcomings

There are many rules in Pong. I simply did not have enough time to implement all of the rules/mechanics that I would have liked to.

Also, as mentioned earlier, I wanted to have my bot be trained rather than told a specific strategy.
